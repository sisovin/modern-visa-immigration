## Description

This project is a modern visa and immigration management system. It consists of a frontend application built with React and Tailwind CSS, and a backend application built with Django. The frontend includes public routes for general access and protected routes for authenticated users. The backend handles user accounts, visa applications, and immigration status updates.

## Frontend

The frontend application is located in the `apps/frontend/` directory. It uses React for building the user interface and Tailwind CSS for styling. The public routes are implemented in the `apps/frontend/app/(main)/` directory, and the protected routes are implemented in the `apps/frontend/app/dashboard/` directory.

### Public Routes

The main public route component is implemented in `apps/frontend/app/(main)/index.tsx`. It provides a welcome page for users to manage their visa applications and immigration status.

### Protected Routes

The protected routes are implemented in the `apps/frontend/app/dashboard/` directory. The `layout.tsx` file contains the dashboard layout component, which includes authentication and authorization mechanisms. The `page.tsx` file contains the main dashboard page component, which fetches and displays user data, visa applications, and immigration status updates. It also provides real-time updates and notifications.

## Backend

The backend application is located in the `apps/backend/` directory. It uses Django as the web framework and includes settings and URL routes for handling user accounts, visa applications, and immigration status updates.

### Settings

The backend settings are configured in the `apps/backend/core/settings.py` file. It includes settings for REST APIs and GraphQL.

### URL Routes

The URL routes are defined in the `apps/backend/core/urls.py` file. It includes routes for user accounts, visa applications, and immigration status updates.
